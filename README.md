# Square Invaders
Square Invaders is my take on the classic space invaders game. 

## Objective
This is the first game I've created from the ground up. 
My goal was to use an Object-Oriented style using techniques such as Polymorphism.
This allows for a modular design that makes it easy to add changes
I included sounds from classic video games such as Double Dragon 2 and The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time.
